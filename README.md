# CordieBot
Brass lamp conversion into a talking, bright-eyed bot.

This bot was created from a brass lamp found in a resale store. It gives a light show and reads aloud sayings recorded on a micro SD card. It was made as a present for my granddaughter's 11th birthday.

The software includes an interrupt from the touch switch to request a randomly chosen saying from the micro SD card. Before speaking, the eyes, brain light, and head light faded in, then a saying is loaded into memory and passed to the speech module, and finally there is a brief light show with the brain light and head light. The lights are always faded in and out, and the brain and head lights are lit with randomly chosen colors.

It includes the following hardware:
  - an Arduino Leonardo computer,
  - an adafruit data logging shield (1141),
  - an adafruit 12 channel PWM LED driver (1455),
  - a SparkFun Emic 2 text to speech board (DEV-11711),
  - a SparkFun Mono Audio Amp (BOB-11044),
  - a fan (Tontec 5V .1A),
  - four 10mm RGB LEDs,
  - a small speaker,
  - a 10K audio taper pot,
  - an adafruit momentary touch capacitance switch (1374),
  - along with assorted wires, nuts & bolts, and connectors.
  
Hal Breidenbach is retired from several careers working with computers. He started in high school writing an amortization program in GATE for a computer in Old Main on the campus of Wayne State University in Detroit. He wrote software for mainframes in Cobol and 360/370 assembler for insurance, financial, and automotive companies as well as for the Stroh Brewery.  For nine years he ran a retail computer store, Spectrum Computers, in Lathrup Village, Michigan, selling Atari, Apple, Compaq, and Altos computers and software, and while doing that designed hardware and software for a fast food point of sale system based on the S-100 bus architecture.  After closing the store he worked on communications and pharmacy applications for Kmart, went to Oakland University in Rochester for a Masters in Computer Systems Engineering, and finally retired from Delphi Automotive after working on engine and transmission software.  Now living in Ann Arbor, he keeps up his software and hardware interests with robots and other projects using small computers.
